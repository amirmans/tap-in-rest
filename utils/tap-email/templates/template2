Hi <?php echo $firstname ?>,
<br>
Welcome to the Tap4markets App!  We are glad you decided to work with us at the <?php echo $market_name?>.  We have an easy onboarding process. There are three simple steps:
<br>
1. Update your Product List with prices and units at the Tap4markets vendor website.  (I will send your company specific URL and password for the website along with a tutorial so you can get started).  Please send an email to me to confirm you have reviewed the tutorial and updated your product list.

2.  Open a payment processor (Stripe) account.  (Instructions for Stripe will be emailed shortly).

3.  Review the video for fulfilling orders. (The video will be emailed when you are all set up to go live).
<br>
Once these three steps are complete, we will verify your stripe key and you can go live.  The pre-order cut off time for orders to be picked up at the market will be <?php echo $pickup_date_time?>.   Any orders that come in after that will be for the following week's market.  I will be using the product list from Manage My Market to fill in your product list.  If you have a more current product list typed or written down, please send it to me ASAP and I will incorporate it into the product list for you.
<br>
Please let me know if you have any questions. I am looking forward to working with you to boost your sales at the market!
